# YoutubeExtension

To get this set up on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Download or open [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). <br>I chose Firefox because I know Firefox extensions that are SIMILAR to what we're doing here available on Firefox, and Firefox is open-source. It's also apprently a bit easier to port to other browsers. We can always change this though.

1. Download this codebase onto your device with:<br> `git clone https://github.com/enigmatic-bacon/YoutubeExtension.git` or similar.

3. In firefox, enter `about:addons` into the URL bar
   
5. Open debug add-ons through the gear icon as shown below <br><br>![The gear icon is in the top right of the addons page](https://github.com/enigmatic-bacon/YoutubeExtension/assets/6007397/60597946-723f-4414-a379-50a3bcb20c52)

6. Click "Load temporary add-on" and open the manifest.json folder as shown below: <br><br>![The button is on the top right of the debug add-ons page](https://github.com/enigmatic-bacon/YoutubeExtension/assets/6007397/3b62e905-65ed-4825-b20e-2a9266f0c16d)

7. Next, if you open a firefox tab and click the right-click the extension, as shown below:<br><br> ![The extensions button is at the top-right of your browser, just to the left of the burger menu](https://github.com/enigmatic-bacon/YoutubeExtension/assets/6007397/811e9a2c-ef30-498b-a535-d445ce987722)

8. Select "Pin to Toolbar"

9. Now, whenever you click the extension on our toolbar (which currently does not have an icon), you'll get a hello world message<br><br>
